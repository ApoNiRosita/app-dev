# My favorite movie
My favorite movie is **The Joker(2019)**: I love The joker because it tells a powerful, emotional story about a man struggling with mental health and societal neglect. Joaquin Phoenixâ€™s performance is outstanding, making the character of Arthur Fleck feel real and complex. The movie challenges you to think about issues like isolation, empathy, and how society treats those who are suffering.
