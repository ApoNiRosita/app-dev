My favorite movie is **"The joker(2019)"** : I love The joker movie because of how deeply it shows the main character's struggle with loneliness and the world’s harshness. Joaquin Phoenix’s powerful acting makes you feel for Arthur Fleck, as you watch him slowly change into the Joker. The movie makes you think about important issues like mental health, society’s treatment of people, and what happens when someone is ignored or pushed too far.
